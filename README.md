# Overview of the AirBnB Clone

The objective of the backend for the Airbnb Clone project is to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts. Features includes 

1. User management
2. Property management
3. Booking system
4. Payment processing
5. Review system

The tech stack used for this project includes Django, Django REST, Postgresql, GraphQL, Celery, RabbitMQ, Redis among others. Roles required for the proper management of this project includes Backend developer, Database administrator, Devops Engineer and QA Engineer.

## Project Goals

**User Management:** Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

**Property Management:** Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.

**Booking System:** Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.

**Payment Processing:** Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.

**Review System:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

**Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. API Documentation
**OpenAPI Standard:** The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.

**Django REST Framework:** Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.

**GraphQL:** Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

### 2. User Authentication
**Endpoints:** `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`

**Features:** Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

### 3. Property Management
**Endpoints:** `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`

**Features:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### 4. Booking System
**Endpoints:** `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`

**Features:** Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

### 5. Payment Processing
**Endpoints:** `/payments/`

**Features:** Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

### 6. Review System
**Endpoints:** `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`

**Features:** Post and manage reviews for properties.

### 7. Database Optimizations
**Indexing:** Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.

**Caching:** Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## Technology Stack

**Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.

**Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.

**PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.

**GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.

**Celery:** For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.

**RabbitMQ:** Broker for queuing and handling asynchronous tasks to workers gracefully 

**Redis:** Used for caching and session management.

**Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.

**CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design

### Key Entities
1. Users
2. Properties
3. Bookings
4. Reviews
5. Payments

### Related Entities
1. **UserProperties:** A user can have multiple properties (one to many relationship)
2. **UserBookings:** A user can book multiple properties (one to many relationship)
3. **UserReviews:** A user can review multiple properties (one to many relationship)
4. **PropertyReviews:** One property can have many reviews (one to many relationship)
5. **UserPayments:** One user can make multiple payments (one to many relationship)
6. **PropertyBookings:** One property can have many bookings (one to many ralationship)

## Team Roles

**Backend Developer:** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

**Database Administrator:** Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.

**DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.

**QA Engineer:** Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## API Documentation Overview

**REST API:** Detailed documentation available through the OpenAPI standard, including endpoints for users, properties, bookings, and payments.

**GraphQL API:** Provides a flexible query language for retrieving and manipulating data.

## API Security

**Authentication:** Each user must provide necessary credentials to be able to access the app showing that they are a bonafide user

**Authorization:** With the Authentication credentials provided, the user would be able to access permitted endpoints and be restricted from accessing endpoints that are not of concern to them. e.g A user that wants to book a property must not be able to edit the property details.

**Input Validation:** All user input must be strictly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks

**Secure Communication:** Utlizing HTTPS/TLs for all request response cycle and encrypting sensitive data is a must to protect confidentiality and prevent eavesdropping

**Rate Limiting:** All Endpoints are gracefully protected from abuse and DDOS attacks by rate limiting the requests that the server can handle with time

**Activity Logging and Monitoring:** All services and requests handled are gracefully logged for proper monitoring and alert

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD is a set of standard practices and tools that automate the process of building, testing and deploying software. CI stands for Continuous Integration which triggers a build and a set of tests for frequently merged codes by developers into a shared repository while CD stands for Continuous Deployment and this ensures that the tested code changes are automatically prepared for release into production without manual approval.

Example of tools used for CICD includes Github actions, CircleCI, Gitlab CI/CD, Jenkins, Teamcity, Bamboo,  Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, etc
